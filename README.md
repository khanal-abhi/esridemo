ESRIDemo
========

This is a simple ios app with a demo of the esri maps.

To run this app, please make sure you have cocopods install. If you have brew, you can use `brew install cocoapods`. Once you have cocoapods install, from the project folder, run `pod install`. That will install all the dependencies. Finally open the `.xcworkspace` of the project in xcode and build and run.
